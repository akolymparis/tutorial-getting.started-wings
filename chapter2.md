## Meet the Web Console

It will be very helpful at this point to take a look at the web console for the platform to help put in 
perspective the relations between the account, 
the applications and the service plans, commands and subscriptions.

![Console Layout](img/Image1.1.png)

As seen in (Image 1.1) the interface consists four  parts. The first (1) is the side menu from which the user can navigate between applications, service plans and subscriptions. From here it is easy to understand the current scope of what is in focus at the moment, for example which application are we viewing. 

The second (2) is the main view where all information relevant to the current selection is shown. In (Image 1.1) the scope is at the top of the account. This means that no application is selected and thus in the menu we get a list of available applications and an option to create a new one (see Image 1.2) while in the main view we see all available application, formatted in blocks that present us with basic information (like the name and UIK) and statistics about each of them.

The third part (3) also has navigation as it's focus. It is a typical HTML style breadcrumb that shows where we are at present in the account tree and also shows all the path we have traversed while navigating here. Finally the fourth part (4) is the user menu, which presents some options about account management (Image 1.3).

## Create a new application

The first thing we need to define is the term application when used in the context of the platform. An application then is a reference to an actual software product that is created and lives inside a developer's account on the server, is identified by a unique identification key [UIK] and can contains multiple and different service plans, commands and rules. The UIK then is given to the developer to incorporate in his actual application and is used during communication with the server so that it is easy for it to identify which software product attempts to communicate with it and recover the relevant information that is requested.
The unique identification key is a string of numbers and alphabetical characters and it is generated by the system whenever a new application is created. Later, in part 2, we will see how the client uses this identifier to contact the server.

If we look at (Image 1.1) we see that at the moment there is only one existing application defined in our account. This is an application that has previously been created to run tests on the system. Lets assume for the purposes of this tutorial that this references one of my previous products that I wished to manage Licensing for. Now, let's go through the process of creating a new application for our hypothetical new product that we also want to manage. The first step is to select the “Create New Application” command from the side menu (see Image 1.2) or the “New Application” button at the top-right of part 2 of the interface as seen in (Image 1.1).

In the main view now we see two new blocks that present us with steps for creating a new application and at the bottom left a “Create” button. In the first (upper) block we see an input text box where we can enter a name for our application. This is the bare minimum of what we have to define in order to create an application. Next to it there is indication of whether the application is in an Active or Pending state. Active means that the application works normally. A software with the right reference (UIK) can communicate with the server and receive licensing info from this application. Pending means that the application is not accessible from the client yet and that some administrator actions are yet required until the state turns to Active. The Pending state is the default state when a new application is created. Once the proper action from the administrator is taken the user is notified either by e-mail or by the web console that the application is now Active.
Go ahead and fill the name form with anything you think is appropriate. For the purposes of this tutorial we are going to name our application “Tutorial Application”.

In the second (lower) block there is an option to “Create New Command” and under it there are two columns names Commands and Rules. Commands are created in the scope of an application and rules are created in the scope of a command. But what is a command? In this context, a Command is a way to further control more specific actions of the client side by defining various behavioral rules for them. For example, let's say that among the many functions our software provides there is one or two which we do not want to be used unlimited times. We can create a command with rules that count the times the command is used by a client  and after a specified calls cut the use until subscription renewal. Another use could be to restrict the use of some functions to specific service plan subscribers only. Let's create to commands that will refer to the two commands (Export/Import) of our plugin as mentioned in the introduction. Click “Create New Command” and on the pop up form (Image 1.5) type “Export Points” in the name field and select “Active” under “State”.

Click “OK” at the bottom right and then repeat the process but this time type “Import Points” in the name field. We don't need to create rules for the commands at this points, we just define them so they exist for the entire application's scope. We will later add rules to them in the scope of specific service plans. Go ahead and press “Create” at the bottom of the main view to complete creating the application. 

![Created Application](img/Image1.4.b.png)

You can now see that on the side menu “Choose Application” has changed to “Tutorial Application”. This signifies that we are now examining the application we just created and also that it has actually been created. You can also see that there are two new labels under the usual side menu, “Service Plans” and “Subscriptions”. If you click on them you will open sub menus that allows you to create new service plans and subscriptions respectively and also list all the available ones for the current application. Since we haven't yet created any such it is empty, but we will revisit this soon. In the main view now you can see blocks with types of information about the application (Image 1.6).

![View Application](img/Image1.6.png)

If you can recall the main view from (Image 1.1) also contained a Statistics block. This block here is similar to that one with the only difference that in that image we are at the root of the navigation tree and we are presented with such blocks for all available applications while here we are presented with a Statistics block for the currently selected application plus two more blocks, one for the name and current state and one for managing commands. The Delete button can remove the application from the system entirely and both the top and bottom save button are used to store any changes made, for example adding commands or renaming.
