## Meet the Web Console

It will be very helpful at this point to take a look at the web console for the platform to help put in 
perspective the relations between the account, 
the applications and the service plans, commands and subscriptions.

As seen in (Image 1.1) the interface consists four  parts. The first (1) is the side menu from which the user can navigate between applications, service plans and subscriptions. From here it is easy to understand the current scope of what is in focus at the moment, for example which application are we viewing. The second (2) is the main view where all information relevant to the current selection is shown. In (Image 1.1) the scope is at the top of the account. This means that no application is selected and thus in the menu we get a list of available applications and an option to create a new one (see Image 1.2) while in the main view we see all available application, formatted in blocks that present us with basic information (like the name and UIK) and statistics about each of them. The third part (3) also has navigation as it's focus. It is a typical HTML style breadcrumb that shows where we are at present in the account tree and also shows all the path we have traversed while navigating here. Finally the fourth part (4) is the user menu, which presents some options about account management (Image 1.3).
